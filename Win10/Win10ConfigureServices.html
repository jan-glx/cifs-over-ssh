<h1>CIFS-over-SSH for Windows 10: Tweaking the 'LanmanServer' driver (old)
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This page is part of the CIFS-over-SSH tutorial for Windows 10. You are reading this
most likely because the method to start the <code>iphlpsvc</code> service using a
system dependency did not work for you. 
<br><br>
Here you will find the old set of instructions, which might work better.


<h2><a name="ConfigureDrivers">Tweaking the 'LanmanServer' driver (old)</a></h2>

Now we first need to tweak a Windows system driver to overcome the thing that 
Microsoft broke. The root cause of the problem is that we need to access the 
file share using TCP port <b>445</b>. However, when Windows 10 boots 
this port is grabbed by the system <code>lanmanserver</code> driver for all interfaces.
By delaying the startup of the <code>lanmanserver</code> driver and by installing a
<code>portproxy</code> rule we can circumvent this. This section explains how 
to do this:

<ul>
<li>Start a console window with elevated (Administrator) privileges.
</li>

<li>First, we disable the automatic starting of the <code>lanmanserver</code> driver:<br>
<pre>
  sc config lanmanserver start= delayed-auto
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b> the space after the <code>start= </code> ! Also, if <code>start= delayed-auto</code> does not 
work then try <code>start= demand</code>
</li>
<li>Make sure the <code>IpHlpSvc</code> driver is running at startup, as otherwise 
the portproxy rules are not executed:<br>
<pre>
  sc config iphlpsvc start= auto
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b> the space after the <code>start= </code> !
<br>
Thanks to Michael Uhlenberg for pointing out this important driver.
</li>
<li>Next we add a <code>portproxy</code> rule to reroute TCP port 445 to a port of
    our choosing. For this tutorial, I choose <b>44445</b>:
<pre>
  netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=10.255.255.1 listenport=445
        connectaddress=10.255.255.1 connectport=44445
</pre>
  <b>IMPORTANT NOTES</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>listenaddress</code> is the address of the Loopback adapter 
        configured in the section earlier
   </li>
    <li>The <code>connectaddress</code>  must be identical to the <code>listenaddress</code>
   </li>
    <li>Using <code>listenaddress=127.0.0.1</code> does not work. Believe me, I've tried.
   </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

If all went well you should see something like<br>

The <code>portproxy</code> rule is persistent, so there should be no need to repeat
this step after a reboot.
