<h1>Mounting your Nikhef home directory using SSH<br>
for Windows 7</h1>
<small><em>(Updated 27/Sep/2019)</em></small>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This tutorial is for Windows 7 but contains mostly screenshots from the English version of Windows Vista.
Separate instructions for other versions of Windows are also available:
<ul>
<li><a href="../WinVista/index.html">Windows Vista</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="../Win8/index.html">Windows 8</a>.
</li>   
<li><a href="../Win10/index.html">Windows 10</a>.
</li>
</ul>   
The instructions for Windows 2000/XP are also still <a href="../WinXP/index.html">available</a>.
<br>

To be able to mount a Windows share over SSH we will need 
<ul>
<li>Administrator access to the local computer, including the ability to 
    <i>elevate</i> privileges. If you don't know what I am talking about then 
    stop reading right here.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY v0.58+</a>,
    which is an excellent and free implementation of SSH for Windows.
    It is assumed that you are familiar with the PuTTY user interface.
</li>
<li>One real or virtual network adapter, bound to the <i>Client for Microsoft Networks</i>
    driver.
    <br>
    Normally you should already have such an adapter, as otherwise you
    would not be able to mount any Windows shares.
</li>
<li>One real or virtual network adapter, <b>NOT</b> bound to the 
    <i>Client for Microsoft Networks</i> driver.
</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

This part of the tutorial is split into the following steps:
<ol>
<li>As most people do not have a spare real network adapter in their computer,
    we will add an extra virtual network adapter by 
    <a href="#Install">installing</a> the
    <b>Microsoft&nbsp;Loopback&nbsp;Adapter</b>.
</li>
<li>After that, the network adapter must be properly 
    <a href="#ConfigureAdapter">configured</a>.
</li>
<li>Furthermore, a few Windows system drivers need to be 
    <a href="#ConfigureDrivers">tweaked</a>.
</li>
<li>Next, reboot Windows to <a href="#Verify">verify</a> that we've been able to 
    grab port 445 and to see if the <code>smb</code> and/or <code>lanmanserver</code>
    drivers are up and running.
</li>
<li>If the port was grabbed, but the drivers are not running, then create a task 
    using the <a href="../WinAddTask.html">Windows Task Scheduler</a> to start the drivers.
</li>
<li>Next, we set up a special
    <a href="#ConfigurePuTTY">PuTTY</a> session with the right port-forwarding.
</li>
<li>Finally, we start PuTTY and <a href="#MountHome">mount</a> our Nikhef home
    directory.
</li>
<br>
<li>For those wishing to <a href="#Undo">undo</a> the above steps follow the 
    instructions at the bottom of this tutorial.
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Install">Installing the Loopback Adapter</a></h2>

To install the Loopback adapter follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Start the <b>Add Hardware Wizard</b> by either going 
    <b>Start->Settings->Control Panel->Add Hardware</b> or by 
    starting a console window with elevated (Administrator) privileges.
    In the console window type
<pre>
  hdwwiz.exe
</pre>
    The Hardware Wizard will come up:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaAddHWwiz1.png" alt="wizardStart">
<li>Click <b>Next</b> to continue:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaAddHWwiz2.png" alt="manualSelect">
    <br>Select <b>Install the hardware that I manually select from a list</b>
    and click <b>Next</b>.
</li>
<li>Now you'll see:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaAddHWwiz3.png" alt="networkAdapters">
    <br>Select the entry <b>Network&nbsp;adapters</b> and click <b>Next</b>.
</li>
<li>In the next screen<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaAddHWwiz4.png" alt="msLoopback">
    <br>first select <b>Microsoft</b> from the list of <i>Manufacturers</i>
    and then select <b>Microsoft&nbsp;Loopback&nbsp;Adapter</b> from the
    list of <i>Network Adapters</i>. Finally, click <b>Next</b> once more.
</li>
<li>Almost finished:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaAddHWwiz5.png" alt="readyToInstall">
    <br>This is your last chance to abort, otherwise, click <b>Next</b>.
</li>
<li>After a while you should see:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaAddHWwiz6.png" alt="finished">
    <br>Click <b>Finish</b> to exit the Hardware Wizard.
</li>
</ul>

You are now ready to configure your newly installed Loopback adapter. Even though
Windows might not ask you to, reboot anyways (heey, it's a Microsoft OS ;-)).<br>
From reports I've seen on the Internet a reboot is sometimes required for the 
loopback adapter to come up properly.
<br>

<h2><a name="ConfigureAdapter">Configuring the Loopback Adapter</a></h2>

Now that your newly installed loopback adapter is up and running we must configure
it properly:

<ul>
<li>Go to the <b>Network Connections Center</b>:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaNetworkConns.png" alt="NetworkConnections"><br>
</li>
<li>Choose the loopback adapter (usually it is named "Local Area Connection #3")
    and right-click on it.
</li>
<li>Choose <b>Properties</b>, after which a new window will appear<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaLoopPropertiesGeneral.png" alt="loopProperties">
    <br>Make sure that
    <ul>
    <li>the entry <b>Client for Microsoft Networks</b>
        is <b>NOT</b> enabled, i.e. does not have a checkmark in front of it.
    </li>
    <li>the entry <b>File and Printer sharing for Microsoft Networks</b>
        is <b>NOT</b> enabled, i.e. does not have a checkmark in front of it.
    </li>
    <li>the entry <b>Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</b> <u>is</u> enabled.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Select the entry <b>Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</b>, then click on
    <b>Properties</b>.
</li>
<li>A new window will appear:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaLoopPropertiesTCPIP.png" alt="loopPropertiesTCPIP">
    <br>Select <b>Use the following IP address</b> and fill in the 'IP address'
    and 'Subnet mask' as above.
    <br>It is not necessary to fill in the 'Default gateway' or a 'DNS server'.
</li>
<li>Click on <b>Advanced</b> to make the following window appear:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaLoopPropertiesTCPIPAdv.png" alt="loopPropertiesTCPIPAdv">
    <br>Deselect <b>Automatic metric</b> and fill in the value of <b>9999</b>
    as the 'Interface metric' as shown above.
</li>
<li>Click on the <b>WINS</b> tab:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaLoopPropertiesWINS.png" alt="loopPropertiesWINS">
    <br>and select <b>Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP</b>.
</li>
<li>Click on <b>OK</b>.
</li>
<li>You are now back in the main 'TCP/IP Properties' screen. Click <b>OK</b> again.
</li>
<li>You are now back in the main 'Loopback Properties' screen. Click <b>Close</b>.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ConfigureDrivers">Tweaking a few Windows drivers</a></h2>

Now we need to tweak a few Windows system drivers to overcome the thing that 
Microsoft broke. The root cause of the problem is that we need to access the
file share using TCP port <b>445</b>. However, when Windows Vista or 7 boots 
this port is grabbed by the system <code>smb</code> driver for all interfaces.
By delaying the startup of the <code>smb</code> driver and by installing a
<code>portproxy</code> rule we can circumvent this. This section explains how 
to do this:

<ul>
<li>Start a console window with elevated (Administrator) privileges.
</li>
<li>First, we disable the automatic starting of the <code>smb</code> driver:<br>
<pre>
  sc config smb start= demand
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b> the space after the <code>start= </code> !
<li>Make sure the <code>IpHlpSvc</code> driver is running at startup, as otherwise 
the portproxy rules are not executed:<br>
<pre>
  sc config iphlpsvc start= auto
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b> the space after the <code>start= </code> !
<br>
Thanks to Michael Uhlenberg for pointing out this important driver.
</li>
<li>Next we add a <code>portproxy</code> rule to reroute TCP port 445 to a port of
    our choosing. For this tutorial, I choose <b>44445</b>:
<pre>
  netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=10.255.255.1 listenport=445
        connectaddress=10.255.255.1 connectport=44445
</pre>
  <b>IMPORTANT NOTES</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>listenaddress</code> is the address of the Loopback adapter 
        configured in the section earlier
   </li>
    <li>The <code>connectaddress</code>  must be identical to the <code>listenaddress</code>
   </li>
    <li>Using <code>listenaddress=127.0.0.1</code> does not work. Believe me, I've tried.
   </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

If all went well you should see something like<br>
<img src="../images/VistaConsole.png" alt="ConfigureConsole">
<br>
The <code>portproxy</code> rule is persistent, so there should be no need to repeat
this step after a reboot.
</li>
<li>Alex Tymick reported that for Windows 7 64bit SP1 a different service needs to be reconfigured:
<pre>
  sc config FDResPub start= demand
</pre>
I have not been able to confirm this, but if disabling automatic startup of  the <code>smb</code> driver
does not work then it's worth trying this one.

<h2><a name="Verify">Reboot and verify</a></h2>

<b>Note</b> I've verified this tutorial on multiple Windows 7 Professional installations,
   patched fully at the date of writing, and the above instructions were sufficient to 
   grab TCP port 445 <b>and</b> to get the 'smb' and 'lanmanserver' drivers in a running state.
<br><br>

Of course, now that we have disabled the automatic startup of the 'SMB' driver we have to
reboot Windows before proceeding.

<ul>
<li>Verify that the <code>portproxy</code> was applied successfully by checking the open ports 
    on the system. Type in the command console
<pre>
  netstat -an | find ":445 "
</pre>
    You should see something like
<pre>
  TCP    10.255.255.1:445    0.0.0.0:0       LISTENING
</pre>
    If you see '<code>0.0.0.0:445</code>' instead then the 'portproxy' rule was not applied
    correctly.  Verify that the right 'portproxy' rule was used
<pre>
  netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4
</pre>
    and verify that the <code>IpHlpSvc</code> driver is running at Windows startup using
<pre>
  sc query iphlpsvc
</pre>
</li>
<li>After Windows comes up and you have logged in, check the status of the 'SMB' driver. Open
    a command console (no privilege elevation is required) and type
<pre>
  sc query smb
  sc query lanmanserver
</pre>
    The 'SMB' and 'LanmanServer' drivers should be in the state <b>Running</b>. 
    If they are not, then follow
    <a href="../WinAddTask.html">these steps</a> to create a task using the Task Schedule
    to start them at system startup.
</li>
</ul>

This also shows the downside of the <code>portproxy</code> method: it is no longer possible
to use local shares on the computer while this rule is active.

<h2><a name="ConfigurePuTTY">Configuring PuTTY</a></h2>

Set up a special PuTTY session with the appropriate <code>port-forwarding</code>:

<ul>
<li>Start PuTTY and create a new session or load your existing session for 
    logging in on <code>login.nikhef.nl</code>. Choose host <b>login2.nikhef.nl</b>
    and protocol <b>SSH</b>.
</li>
<li>Expand the <b>Connection->SSH</b> menu option in the <i>Category</i> tree-list 
    and select <b>Tunnels</b>.
</li>
<li>Add a new forwarded port:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaPuTTYConfigLoopTunnels1.png" alt="puttyLoopTunnels1">
    <br><ul>
    <li>For the <b>Source port</b>, fill in the <i>IP address</i> of your 
        loopback adapter, plus the port <b>44445</b> (<b>NOT</b> 445!).
        The entry field might seem
        to small for it, but it will work. If you have configured your
        loopback adapter exactly as in the previous section, then fill in<br>
        <b>10.255.255.1:44445</b>.
    <li>For the <b>Destination</b>, fill in <b>beuk.nikhef.nl:445</b>.
    </li>
    <li>Click on <b>Add</b>.
    </li>
    </ul>
<li>You should now see:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaPuTTYConfigLoopTunnels2.png" alt="puttyLoopTunnels2">
</li>
<li>In the <i>Category</i> tree-list on the left, scroll back up and choose
    <b>Session</b> again. Save your session.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="MountHome">Putting it all together</a></h2>

Now that we have configured both our loopback adapter and PuTTY we can put it
all together and mount our Nikhef home directory as a Windows share:

<ul>
<li>Start your newly created Nikhef-PuTTY session and login on 
    <code>login2.nikhef.nl</code> as normal.
</li>
<li>Make sure port-forwarding is working properly by checking the PuTTY
    event log. Select the Window menu of the PuTTY screen (top left) and 
    select <b>Event log</b>. You should see a log similar to:<Br>
    <img src="../images/VistaPuTTYEventLog.png" alt="puttyEventLog">
    <br>If not, then check your PuTTY session options first.
</li>
<li>Go to <b>Start->Run</b> and type <b>\\10.255.255.1\user\&lt;Your-nikhef-userid&gt;</b>
</li>
<li>You will be prompted to authenticate yourself:<br>
    <img src="../images/VistaLoopLogin.png" alt="networkLogin">
    <br>For the <i>Username</i>, fill in the domain <b>NIKHEF\</b> followed
    by your Nikhef-Windows userid.
    <br>For the <i>Password</i>, fill in your Nikhef-Windows password, which
    might be different from the password you use to log in on 
    <code>login2.nikhef.nl</code> and press <b>OK</b>.
</li>
<li>You should now see your Nikhef home directory in Windows Explorer!
</li>
</ul>

<center><i>Congratulations!</i></center>

<h4>Mapping a network drive</h4>

To make life even easier it might be handy to map a network drive to your
Nikhef home directory:

<ul>
<li>Start Windows Explorer and choose <b>Tools->Map Network Drive</b>.
</li>
<li>In the next screen, fill in:<br>
    <img src="../images/Win7MapNetworkDrive.png" alt="Win7MapNetworkDrive" width="500">
    <ul>
    <li>Choose an available drive letter.
    </li>
    <li>Do <b>NOT</b> click on <i>Browse</i> but type in as the <i>Folder</i>
        name:
        <b>\\10.255.255.1\user\&lt;Your-nikhef-userid&gt;</b>
    </li>
    <li>Enable the checkbox in front of <b>Connect using different credentials</b>.
    </li>
    <li>Now click on <b>Finish</b>.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>In the next screen, fill in your Nikhef-Windows userid:<br>
    <img src="../images/Win7NetworkCreds" alt="Win7NetworkCreds" width="380">
    <br>For the <i>User name</i>, fill in the domain <b>NIKHEF\</b> followed
    by your Nikhef-Windows userid.
    <br>For the <i>Password</i>, fill in your Nikhef-Windows password, which
    might be different from the password you use to log in on 
    <code>login.nikhef.nl</code> and press <b>OK</b>.
</li>
</li>
<li>In the next screen, click on <b>Finish</b> to complete the network drive mapping.
</li>
<li>You should now see a new drive letter appear in the <i>Folders</i> tree-list
    in Windows Explorer. Click on it to verify that you are indeed viewing your
    Nikhef home directory.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Undo">Control+Z! Undo! Undo!</a></h2>

For those wishing to undo the CIFS-over-SSH trick follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Start a console window with elevated (Administrator) privileges.
</li>
<li>Restore the automatic startup of the <code>smb</code> driver by typing
<pre>
  sc config smb start= auto
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b> the space after the <code>start= </code> !
</li>
